## PROJECT_TITLE:
# **"Data-Driven_Analysis_for_Student_Mentorship"**<br><br><br>


## DESCRIPTION:
This data analysis project aims to identify students facing socio-economic barriers to success using advanced analytics techniques such as K-means clustering and logistic regression. The project retrieves data from various sources like MySQL, MongoDB, and Spark, and applies data preprocessing, EDA, and ML modeling to extract insights.<br><br><br>



## **STEP:1**  *DATA COLLECTION*<br>
  
  #### **SOURCE:**<br>
   STUDENT-DATABASE - Students_performance - “kaggle.com”<br>
  #### **URL:**<br>
   “https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/”<br><br><br>



## **STEP-2:**  *DATA_RETRIEVAL FROM VARIOUS TOOLS-(MYSQL, MONGODB, SPARK)*<br>

  In the initial phase of the data analysis process, data retrieval was performed using several tools, including MySQL, MongoDB, and Spark. The purpose of this step was to gather the required data from these different sources in order to conduct further analysis.<br><br><br>
  
  
  
## **STEP-3:**  *DATA CLEANING (JUPYTER NOTEBOOK_ VS-CODE)*<br>
  
   In this step, we used Jupyter Notebook and VS Code to clean the data downloaded in the previous step. 
   The cleaning process involved removing missing values, handling duplicates ect,. 
   The cleaned data was saved to a new CSV file for further processing and analysis.<br><br><br>
  
 
   
## **STEP-4:**  *EXPLORATORY-DATA_ANALYSIS(EDA)*<br>

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves examining and visualizing the data to gain insights, understand patterns, detect outliers, and formulate hypotheses. EDA provides a deeper understanding of the dataset and helps guide further analysis and modeling. <br><br><br>
    
    
    
## **STEP-5**  *MACHINE LEARNING MODELS*<br>
   #### LOGISTIC REGRESSION (CLASSIFICATION MODEL)####
   
   Logistic Regression is a popular supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is particularly useful when the dependent variable is categorical. The goal of logistic regression is to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class or category.<br><br>
   
   #### K-MEANS CLUSTERING (CLUSTERING MODEL)####
   
   K-means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering or grouping similar data points together. It partitions the data into K distinct clusters based on their feature similarity.<br><br>
